## Description

Sindri is a software developed to estimate thermodynamics properties and vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations using cubic equations of state.

This software was developed as part of a undergraduate thesis in Chemical Engineer bachelor degree in Universidade Federal de Lavras, Brazil.

### Features

- 20 cubic equation of state implemented for all types of calculations. The equation currently used
can be easily changed, which provides a quickly comparision tool
- Calculation of thermodynamics properties for single substances and multicomponent mixtures
- Multiple saturation diagram plots for pure substances
- Vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations for mixtures: bubble point, dew point and P-T-z flash calculations
- Binary mixture isothermal and isobaric equilibrium curves. The models can be adjusted to
experimental data by fitting a binary interaction parameter
- Reports generation
- Modifiable database with more than 469 substances

## Getting Started

### Installing

## Contribution

Any bug reports or suggestions are welcome. Also, if wish a new cubic equation of state
implemented, please send me the paper and I will try to add it as soon as possible.
