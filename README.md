## Description

Sindri is a software developed to estimate thermodynamics properties and vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations using cubic equations of state.

This software was developed as part of an undergraduate thesis to obtain a bachelor degree in Chemical Engineering at the Federal University of Lavras, Brazil.

### Features

- 20 cubic equations of state implemented for all calculations. The active equation 
can be easily changed, which provides a quickly comparison tool
- UNIFAC method (group contribution method) for determining activity coefficients
- Calculation of thermodynamics properties for single substances and multicomponent mixtures
- Multiple saturation diagram plots for pure substances
- Vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations for mixtures: bubble point, dew point and P-T-z flash calculations
- Binary mixture isothermal and isobaric equilibrium curves. The models can be adjusted to
experimental data by fitting a binary interaction parameter
- Generates calculation reports
- Modifiable database with 468 substances

## Getting Started

### Installing
